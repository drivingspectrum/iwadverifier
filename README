IWAD Verifier is a program by LichSoft Software which allows users who own
various Doom Engine games to check their main data files (IWADs) to see if
they have been modified or corrupted at some point.

This utility uses the MD5 message digest algorithm and does a comparison via
hash strings located in the hashes.ini file.

== Platforms Supported ==

The original versions of IWAD Verifier were written in Delphi, which wasn't
very portable to other platforms. This new version uses wxWidgets and C++.
It should support any platform wxWidgets supports.

Currently, only Windows builds are shipped with this package, they are Unicode
enabled by default.

== Usage ==

Under Windows, just run the executable (iwadverifier.exe), Click the Browse
button and select the IWAD you wish to check. Press the Check button and
view the results.
